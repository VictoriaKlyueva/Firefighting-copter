# Convolutional neural network that can detect forest fires and GUI for it
It's Quantorium (children's technopark) project I made in the 11th grade

## That project:
- won regional project exposition
- won All-Russian Project Competition "Promobil"
- participant of the first All-Russian forum of Quatorians
- participant of All-Russian festival "Технопредки"

## About files
- wildfire.ipynb      notebook for learning and saving model
- main.py             the GUI app with OpenCV that use model and camera for classificating image from camera in real time
- saved_model.onnx    saved trained model
- kaggle.json         kaggle API (not actual) for downloading dataset from kaggle.com

## About project
Our team downloaded the GUI app (main.py) on Raspberry PI 4. 
It use device's camera and make it possible to classificate image from it in real time
We used this design on a drone with flight assignment.
